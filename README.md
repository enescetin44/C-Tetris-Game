\# C-Tetris: Console-Based Game Logic



This project is a CLI (Command Line Interface) implementation of a Tetris-like game, developed in C. It focuses on core programming concepts such as dynamic memory management, 2D matrix manipulation, and collision detection.



\## 🚀 Key Features

\* \*\*Dynamic Grid System:\*\* Users can define custom game board dimensions (M x N) at runtime.

\* \*\*Collision Detection:\*\* Advanced logic to prevent shape overlapping and manage grid boundaries.

\* \*\*Row Clearing \& Scoring:\*\* Automatically detects full rows, clears them, shifts the grid down, and calculates scores.

\* \*\*Random Shape Generation:\*\* Includes 6 different geometric shapes with rotation capabilities.

\* \*\*High Score Tracking:\*\* Keeps track of the best performance within the session.



\## 🛠️ Technical Details

\* \*\*Language:\*\* C

\* \*\*Memory Management:\*\* Utilizes `malloc` and `calloc` for efficient 2D array handling.

\* \*\*Portability:\*\* Uses ANSI escape codes for screen clearing, making it compatible with modern terminals.

\* \*\*Data Structures:\*\* Intensive use of nested loops and 2D matrices for game state management.



## 🕹️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/enescetin44/C-Tetris-Game.git](https://github.com/enescetin44/C-Tetris-Game.git)
